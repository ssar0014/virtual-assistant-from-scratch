# Virtual Assistant From Scratch

I will be attempting to make a virtual assistant from scratch using Python, and its deep learning library Tensorflow (Using the Keras API).

For now the main objective is to build a Voice recognition system. I shall be adding more functionalities later on. This is a hobby project, and is not meant for commercialisation.
